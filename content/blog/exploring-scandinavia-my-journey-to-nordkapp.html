<article id="1ad77955-515e-8043-b703-cbaa016709d2" class="page sans"><div class="page-body"><p id="25d77955-515e-8055-9c3e-cbb54aba2bae" class="">Ever since I bought my new adventure bike, I knew that one day I had to go on a trip to the very north. I cannot explain why exactly I was so thrilled about this journey, as there’s not really much interesting to see along the way, except for the highways and never-ending forests. At least that’s what some people would tell me. But something in my mind kept bugging me. I saw several motorcyclists setting off on this journey, and I always found it super interesting.</p><p id="25d77955-515e-8065-9982-fa504ad2fff3" class="">I don’t know, maybe it was just the feeling of freedom, an idea of a very long trip where anything can happen, or the fact that I never know where I’d end up every night. Maybe it was the solitude and the bond between the bike and me. Or maybe I just wanted to ride somewhere far away and check off this goal on my bucket list. After all, there are much nicer roads in Europe that are more popular among bikers. Well, whatever it was, I just couldn’t give up on this idea.</p><p id="25d77955-515e-80e1-bdd0-debce52c8972" class="">And so the D-day came in. My plan was to start in Prague, take a ferry from Germany to Denmark, travel through the entire Sweden, then cross through Finland, and finally reach the northernmost point in Europe - Nordkapp, in Norway. After that, I’d ride and explore the beautiful nature of Norway on my way back.</p><p id="25777955-515e-805a-bd9b-eb2e7298914b" class="">Along the whole journey, I was keeping a short journal to jot down my memories and experiences. This article is, therefore, a compilation of my thoughts from this incredible trip.</p><h3 id="25777955-515e-8001-a13c-fe2a71b38d04" class="">Day 1 - Getting to the first ferry</h3><p id="25e77955-515e-8000-9586-c186a027085e" class="">It’s Wednesday, 18.6.2025, and finally, the big day has come. I set off for Nordkapp. In the morning, I packed up the bike and rolled out. To be honest, I didn’t really feel like going at first — more like I was a bit scared. But the moment I actually got on the road, all of that disappeared… and was instantly replaced with the fun of dealing with a Prague traffic jam 😅.</p><div id="25e77955-515e-8028-a221-ccc33e617449" class="column-list"><div id="25e77955-515e-80e8-9b9b-d1328caa8ce5" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="25e77955-515e-80e0-9184-dba6dc0f2502" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day1-departure.jpg"><img style="width:709.9921875px" src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/previews/day1-departure.jpg" data-src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day1-departure.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div><div id="25e77955-515e-80e4-8f14-fe1125886ad9" style="width:50%" class="column"><p id="25e77955-515e-8007-9b69-cb32195869cb" class="">Eventually, I made it out of the city, stopped to pump up the tires and fill up the tank, and then it was straight onto the highway, heading for Germany. The whole ride was just highways, but surprisingly, it wasn’t bad at all. I stopped a few times for fuel and to stretch my legs.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-80ce-950a-cdfa82e2013b" class="">At one point, I started getting really tired — probably because I barely slept the night before, thanks to all the packing. So I pulled over, chilled for a bit, and then tried out my “manual cruise control.” Honestly, it was awesome. The road somehow just flew by, and before I knew it, I had made it to the campsite.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-80f6-bc45-ed7cffcab40e" class="">
</p></div></div><p id="25e77955-515e-80d9-aee8-f41ba1ba9290" class="">I was a little worried it might be full, but when I arrived, there was only one car. So I pitched my tent, gave it a quick waterproofing spray, and took it easy for a while. Later, I wandered across a field to check out this little private lake they have there, and when I came back… surprise — a tick had hitched a ride on me 😏. Pulled it out, and now I’ll just have to keep an eye on the wound.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-801b-9432-ed5416c05606" class="">Oh, and one more thing: I realized I already lost the slider from my boot — that little piece of plastic that protects your foot when leaning the bike. Great start to the trip 😅.</p><p id="25d77955-515e-8004-9c75-eada68c5a136" class=""><strong>Today’s leg - </strong>Prague (CZ) → Rostock (DE) (582km)</p><figure id="25e77955-515e-8059-adea-d94942cd162e" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day1-camp.jpg"><img  src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/previews/day1-camp.jpg" data-src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day1-camp.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure><h3 id="25777955-515e-8075-be43-f644a4acb554" class="">Day 2 - Hello Denmark</h3><p id="25e77955-515e-80fd-9658-d2bb97e43d95" class="">I started the day at the port, where I chatted with a Czech guy who said something that stuck with me: <em>“Everyone heads south — the Alps, Romania… but this is a nice change.

There, I bought more stickers, beer, and something for breakfast. From there, the ride finally got nicer: winding roads, a bit of nature, and the classic red Swedish houses.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-8073-9b96-f7ec8395491c" class="">The first campsite was full, but a helpful owner pointed me to another one nearby. After a wrong turn (straight into someone’s backyard), I finally found it, set up camp, showered, and called it a day.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-805f-ad39-d9cc937fa9f7" class=""><strong>Today’s leg - </strong>Rostock → Örkelljunga (SWE) (330km)</p></div><div id="25e77955-515e-8060-b639-f68273cc6e73" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="25e77955-515e-80f0-9570-fc84bddfcf12" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day2-nyhavn.jpg"><img  src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/previews/day2-nyhavn.jpg" data-src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day2-nyhavn.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div></div><p id="25e77955-515e-804a-b854-e5745c7827f9" class="">

The ride went smoothly, but I had to stop at Biltema to buy a new battery — mine is dying, and I don’t want to risk it further north.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-8042-973e-c4b127f7c476" class="">By evening, I made it to the campsite, but of course, it was full. Nearby places either didn’t answer or turned out to be just fire pits, not real campsites. In the end, I found a hotel in Uppsala for €50, which actually felt like a nice break — a proper bed for once.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-8052-bd78-e1ff09be434e" class="">Also, today is <em>Midsummer Eve</em>, the big Swedish holiday where people celebrate the summer solstice with dancing, food, and lots of drinking.</p><p id="25e77955-515e-80b7-a4fc-d8decf35f7b0" class=""><strong>Today’s leg - </strong>Örkelljunga → Uppsala  (255km)</p><figure id="25e77955-515e-80c3-816f-d3e21c1c382f" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day3-hotel.jpg"><img  src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/previews/day3-hotel.jpg" data-src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day3-hotel.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure><h3 id="25777955-515e-8022-86b6-f19c142fb6a7" class="">Day 4 - Forests everywhere</h3><p id="25e77955-515e-8058-9440-d6e301fc974d" class="">I left the hotel in the morning and did a quick 100 km stretch before stopping at a Lidl for breakfast. Funny how distance perception changes on a trip like this — suddenly 100 km feels like “just around the corner.”</p><p id="25e77955-515e-805b-a80d-d35357feffcf" class="">Along the way, I crossed an impressive bridge, which happened to be Högakustenbron. I made a quick stop to take some photos. The ride towards Umeå was smooth; even though it was mostly highway, the scenery kept changing — forests, lakes, villages — so it never felt boring.</p><figure id="25e77955-515e-80d3-a714-f2deb9fafb6a" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day4-bridge.jpg"><img  src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/previews/day4-bridge.jpg" data-src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/1ad77955515e8043b703cbaa016709d2/day4-bridge.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure><p id="25e77955-515e-80d9-8a9a-fef7a5e86001" class="">Since I was making good progress, I decided to follow signs for cultural landmarks, taking detours through smaller roads and villages.
