<article id="9d00f2fb-1837-43f3-9334-78da5b446c39" class="page sans"><div class="page-body"><p id="26fc16b6-f145-4fd0-9ad2-023195fde088" class="">At the beginning of the year, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandratomasova/">girlfriend</a> and I spent four weeks on the roads of this beautiful country. This was our first time in South America and we were really amazed and got lots of experiences and memories, so I thought I would write down some notes of our adventure and maybe share some tips and tricks.</p><p id="0cc26975-48ed-4f44-bc49-e731ab19b982" class=""><em>If you came here only for some tips and don’t want to read the whole post (😞) you can scroll down to the tips section.</em></p><h2 id="8da477f9-6d51-46cf-b301-09c850eb26ca" class="">Arriving in Argentina</h2><h3 id="7f825217-c64e-40b6-81b5-60979ce81334" class="">Getting here ✈️</h3><p id="b54615be-a88d-4c57-a482-94582d47426b" class="">Our journey started at the airport in Prague. We were aiming for the cheapest flight which in the end showed up to be Prague → Munich → Montreal → Sao Paulo → Buenos Aires 😅. Yeah, it surely took some time to finally get there, we had a couple of hours delay in Canada and also a one-hour stopover in Sao Paulo, where we had to disembark, go through the customs again and embark on the same airplane. </p><p id="5823fafd-22a9-4c28-9cab-fbc2269065e9" class="">Finally, we arrived at Buenos Aires airport where the next challenge began. We had to get SIM cards and find a taxi. Both things sound like pretty simple and straightforward tasks to accomplish, but that wasn’t our case. At the airport, we bought a <a href="https://www.personal.com.ar/">Personal</a> card and tried to activate it. We were told it should take no more than a few minutes — after half an hour we gave up. Using the local Wi-Fi we tried to get a taxi. In Argentina, Uber is available as well as their local app <a href="https://cabify.com/ar">Cabify</a> <em>(the latter has usually better prices</em>). After some time of trying to figure out where are we actually standing and where is our taxi coming we found the guy. After getting in he asked us to pay in cash. At this point, we were confused and surprised as we didn’t have any cash and were hoping for a normal card payment via the app. Eventually, after some discussion in broken Spanish, we had to get off and keep looking for another taxi. Finally, we found one and after so many exhausting hours of traveling, we just wished to get to the bed asap.</p><h3 id="4f77784e-36f4-49f1-b075-17d0ea643ac6" class=""><strong>Documents 📄</strong></h3><p id="bb23630b-11fd-4a28-a114-bae96db4232f" class="">As we were traveling during the covid pandemic, there were several requirements and documents to present to be allowed to enter the country. Here’s the list:</p><ul id="40644fad-b2ef-4667-8afe-91a96980780c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">COVID-19 vaccination ✅&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id="34ced71c-c5e4-4176-b3ed-ef8a34030ce1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">negative PCR test ✅&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id="ed1de042-6d8d-4d17-a9c5-b9003fba69d4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Insurance covering covid expenses ✅&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id="fc421fc9-a806-417a-ab60-de34832df244" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">filled in the <a href="https://ddjj.migraciones.gob.ar/app/home.php">entry form</a> ✅</li></ul><p id="a196bb8c-4ebf-43a9-810a-354d61645d1b" class="">
</p><p id="7066ccd2-2165-4601-84b7-4a70eb02f764" class="">Some people on the internet said you even need a <strong>returning flight ticket </strong>to prove that you will leave the country. This was quite tricky for me as I planned to stay here for an unknown time as my girlfriend was going to study here. To meet this requirement I used a so-called <a href="https://bestonwardticket.com/">temporary ticket</a>, which cost ~$14, looks completely legit (you can verify it on the airlines’ website) and is valid for a few days.</p><p id="658891cf-4033-4092-b60f-384660592de8" class="">When we came to the border control at the airport, the officer just asked about the reason for my travel and that was it. He didn’t care about anything of the above-mentioned 😅. Then I got a stamp allowing me to stay in the country for 90 days. Truth to be told though, they checked some of those requirements right away in Prague and later in Canada.</p><h2 id="0b1621d0-034b-4e05-bfb3-ddade1d7d002" class="">First days in the country (learning how it works here)</h2><p id="a01cfe21-55ea-4ddd-a509-035a0b81346f" class="">The next day after coming from the airport we had two big priorities - get some cash and a functioning SIM card.</p><h3 id="33bba29b-86c1-40a5-99ae-2d0936e48847" class="">SIM card 📞</h3><p id="a470d4ab-5f6e-4257-92e3-e2e281e4e54c" class="">As I mentioned earlier we were unable to get the Personal card working so we had to find some alternative. Our friends recommended us <a href="https://www.claro.com.ar/">Claro</a>. So, we went to the shop, brought our passports with us and asked for a tourist SIM card. We paid around 1000 ARS and got a really good deal of 10GB for 30 days. Also, I have to mention that it started working immediately 🎉. They have a nice website where you can check your spending and also recharge if needed.</p><h3 id="69a63229-5b34-4ffb-b16a-53d2053ef2ca" class=""><strong>Money 💰</strong></h3><p id="190a9ca9-77d7-445b-82f9-f54b441c3cf0" class="">I’m no economic expert nor do I know much about the politics of the country but the fact is that even though the country is the third biggest economy in South America (after Mexico and Brazil), they struggle with corruption, big debt and inflation 😕.</p><p id="45c4f4b1-3c0e-4979-a897-0b0f9ae15dd9" class="">To mention some interesting (useful) facts:</p><ul id="c9ccef78-7253-4980-845c-4f6d4a3d46f6" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>cash preferred payments</strong> — most of the time you will see people paying by cash. It was a bit hard for me to get used to it as I quickly got spoiled by paying for everything using my phone back in Europe. But speaking of paying by phone, some people also use QR payments, which I’m not sure if you as a tourist can get to work as well, but they just simply scan a code and show the payment result to the cashier. Payments by card are also possible, but often they take the card from you and swipe it by themselves (this felt a little uncomfortable so we decided to put a sticker over the security code 💡) and usually ask for your ID card and signature on the receipt. The reason for preferring cash over cards is simple - you’ll pay much more when paying by card. Some stores even say things like “15% discount” when paying in cash. </li></ul><ul id="ff37c326-6513-482d-9f77-302228f17542" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>high inflation (~50%)</strong> - this is really bad and money quickly loses its value.

In reality, the unofficial rate has almost double the value of the original rate. Currently, for <strong>1€</strong> you would get <strong>122$ </strong>(arg. pesos) or you could get<strong> 205$ </strong>on the blue market 🤯. This means if you pay with cash you can save a lot of money, i.e. everything is almost half the price. Some locals offer you exchange dollars for pesos using the unofficial rate but we relied on <a href="https://www.westernunion.com/">WesternUnion</a> which uses this rate too. However, until this day, I still don’t understand how exactly this whole system works 🤷‍♂️. But I think it has something to do with the government, not using cards and the inflation.</li></ul><h2 id="68a1ae82-1016-49f6-9528-9f0b77c7616b" class="">Finally traveling 🙈 </h2><p id="066c0077-e49e-41c5-9e66-401f599e15f8" class="">After a few days in Buenos Aires, the time has come and we went to the airport again. We didn’t have a strict day-to-day plan but we had a list of things that we wanted to see and always planned for the next few days accordingly.</p><p id="8605c56a-823c-4199-9a29-dc10d58d8022" class="">Our main plan outline looked like this:</p><ul id="81290d33-2f92-45c8-817d-7a80dcf1f2c5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">⛰️ <strong>Patagonia</strong> — We planned to hike some trails in the Patagonian mountains in El Chalten and see the Perito Moreno glacier in El Calafate.</li></ul><ul id="0cfcd935-cd0d-492d-b91c-3dac4b2aa1fe" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">❌&nbsp;<del><strong>Chile</strong></del><del> —  Continue with hiking in the Chilean part of the mountains.</del> Due to the pandemic, the borders were closed and restrictions were quite strict, so it got complicated (<em>but not impossible</em>), hence we decided to keep Chile for another time. </li></ul><ul id="3b923afd-e563-4b73-82fa-31507608f5b4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>🐧&nbsp;Puerto Madryn</strong> — Next stop was to see penguins in their natural habitat in Punta Tombo.</li></ul><ul id="24314b3e-4cae-4567-a5d0-96204cd4b305" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">🆕<strong>&nbsp;Salta &amp; Jujuy</strong> — Because we canceled Chile, we got extra time for exploring other parts of Argentina.

Therefore, we bought all other flights with <a href="https://www.aerolineas.com.ar/">Aerolineas Argentinas</a> which is a national airline and we were very happy with them 💯. And, you can buy the flight tickets in cash 😂.</div></figure><p id="9eceb9b0-d1d0-4135-84fb-6fb5d905c45c" class="">After landing in El Calafate, we decided to go to El Chalten first as it seemed more suitable for hiking based on the weather forecast for the upcoming days. We took a bus (3 hours) directly from the airport. There are multiple companies operating in Patagonia, we chose <a href="https://www.taqsa.com.ar/">Marga Taqsa</a>. We have always tried to check reviews on the internet before but we learned people are often complaining about little things or reviews are contradictory, so it’s best to try them out for yourself 😛. You can buy tickets online on <strong><a href="https://www.busbud.com/">busbud.com</a></strong><strong> </strong>which we used quite extensively but beware that sometimes they require to have a ticket <strong>printed out</strong>!!</p><p id="6b901d6e-ee4c-4eb5-ae50-70301a4be51e" class="">Overall, the quality of buses in South America seems to be okay (at least for the tourist buses) and they usually have comfortable seats with more leg room designed for the long-distance journeys. I think buses here are even better than in Europe.</p><figure id="f9b08ee8-f575-4f6c-8e5f-acf7e0b5a2b8" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2026.jpg"><img style="width:1958px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2026.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2026.jpg" class="lazyload"></a><figcaption>Entrance to the town of El Chalten</figcaption></figure><p id="1e2f537c-4fd8-4803-9ea5-74a1c37cfc6f" class=""><strong>El Chalten</strong></p><p id="f09c8a72-1a58-41e7-b459-5e327bacec09" class="">The first thing we saw after getting off the bus was this amazing view of the mountains 😍. The second thing we noticed is there was no cellular network 😅&nbsp;(!) So keep that in mind and try to download all important documents and maps offline. Later, we learned this is the case in many parts of Argentina. But this fact strengthened our appreciation of this place even more and we could enjoy this magical nature without interruptions.</p><p id="3da6cb8a-974a-444c-b763-b0d62f25350b" class="">We were here during the summer season (end of January), so the prices for accommodation were quite high even though we had an average-looking hotel with breakfast and even no running water sometimes. However, this was the issue of the town as we learned later. Anyway, lots of microbreweries and many hikers in the town made really great vibe and we enjoyed our stay very much.</p><figure id="4b55013e-651b-4675-8d73-5a9770f4b26f" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2235.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2235.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2235.jpg" class="lazyload"></a><figcaption>View from our hike to Fitz Roy</figcaption></figure><p id="cc015e9f-99e9-4be7-92f1-6b48cd34be8d" class="">The next morning we went on our first hike - Mount Fitz Roy. The hike is more than 20 kilometers long and takes 8-10 hours to complete. The scenery along the way is picturesque and we had to stop many times just to snap a picture. Overall, the hike wasn’t very difficult and challenging until the last part where you have to ascend a very steep hill for an hour to reach the lake. There is even a warning saying that you should really consider your abilities. But it wasn’t that hard after all, if you don’t sit on a couch all day long you will be fine.</p><div id="c14bfa31-4e3f-49e5-8668-970181b88d5a" class="column-list"><div id="15b9a527-1c8f-4155-ba0f-d69beff2eace" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="9efbba97-2d40-4ee6-aeb3-43dccda96bbf" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2147.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2147.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2147.jpg" class="lazyload"></a><figcaption>Beautiful views along the way</figcaption></figure></div><div id="439b806d-ae08-42b1-a248-1ef211473c2a" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="5089118c-bd3f-4ef1-853b-9918ca2c26ee" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2390.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2390.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2390.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div></div><p id="c8839990-de77-4144-8cbc-df9cc80401a8" class="">Along the way there is a two-way split, the first way goes to Laguna Capri, where there is also a place for campers. The other one goes to a viewpoint from which you can see the mountain.

The hike itself was not so difficult but the fact that we lose our fight with the sun the day before made the whole trek challenging and painful. We got everything covered this time, we wore long-sleeve T-shirts, long pants, a hat, and even covered our necks so you can imagine how uncomfortable it had been hiking and sweating on a high-temperature sunny day. Still, we got sun burnt - our poor lips this time 😩.</p><p id="b03458d9-ff08-4f2a-9b22-e78a5017c5f9" class="">But all this pain was 100% worth the views we got to see 🙈!</p><figure id="104ac6f7-c085-4d81-9ae8-f9bfda960844" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2481.jpg"><img style="width:1371px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2481.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2481.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure><figure id="198787e0-9dd3-48fd-9f28-fcb00023b3de" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2475.jpg"><img style="width:1958px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2475.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2475.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure><div id="0afee895-441e-45ea-bf89-7cc5e54fb065" class="column-list"><div id="bd12f247-35e9-41cc-9744-5177b9941ef3" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="d554847f-c7e2-4e25-9961-02ded36dfc1b" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_3759.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_3759.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_3759.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div><div id="cb90cfd0-6422-4e8f-8f35-75c65b4e5932" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="537bd76e-a329-44e9-b5e0-c4ffd39d5f02" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2578.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_2578.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_2578.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div></div><p id="f72e2d5c-4b8c-4c34-ab09-9f8760d76724" class="">After completing both treks, we had our last day in El Chalten so we decided to go catch the sunrise in the morning.

Next time I’d probably hire a guide 😄.</p><h3 id="b503021b-5227-4cc3-9ded-e229bbf9b2c4" class="">Day 7</h3><p id="95869130-c2f0-4bd2-9857-3f0dd56c557a" class="">Cafayate is a city of wine, which means you have to stay there at least for a day or two to explore it a bit. There are many vineyards and small wineries around so we went to check out one. The specialty of this city is <strong>wine ice cream</strong>, which you should definitely try. It was amazing 😋.</p><div id="7a4706c1-89bf-4bcb-81c1-879e1377df56" class="column-list"><div id="ddaf33f1-03d3-443b-a6c7-36f7e1f90a41" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="f26a19dd-12cd-4754-b369-6d753c0838a3" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_1513.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_1513.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_1513.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div><div id="ed3f7c66-bb09-4850-9751-c50aa0c9bf45" style="width:50%" class="column"><figure id="bb9439a0-5e43-4d52-b3e5-b0499bdf8a04" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_1512.jpg"><img style="width:1419px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/previews/IMG_1512.jpg" data-src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/9d00f2fb183743f3933478da5b446c39/IMG_1512.jpg" class="lazyload"></a></figure></div></div><p id="0f0aee4e-7564-40d9-9c91-897fdd78557b" class="">The whole region lies in <strong>Calchaquí Valleys</strong>, an area known for its red rock formations.
