<article id="23777955-515e-809e-8669-dc868551af65" class="page sans"><div class="page-body"><p id="24077955-515e-8002-90ca-d925c83dbd38" class="">Recently, I realized I’ve collected quite a few handy little items that I use almost every day. For a long time, I didn’t even know “Everyday Carry” — or EDC — was a thing. I’ve just always been drawn to cool-looking, compact gear that feels good in the hand.</p><figure id="23f77955-515e-8024-a30f-e5bd508888f3" class="image"><a href="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/23777955515e809e8669dc868551af65/full.jpg"><img style="width:2931px" src="http://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/23777955515e809e8669dc868551af65/full.jpg"></a></figure><p id="24077955-515e-804b-b733-edb0d95ea28e" class="">Now that my collection has grown, I thought it’d be fun to share the stuff that makes my day-to-day life a little better. Hopefully, you’ll find something inspiring here — and if you’ve got any favorite pocket gear of your own, I’d love to hear about it!</p><p id="23777955-515e-805b-9baa-d89abb22b6b7" class=""><strong>iPhone 12 </strong>[<a href="https://www.apple.com/by/iphone-12/specs/">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-800e-a957-e54f659fa0cb" class="">I’m still using the iPhone 12 — a bit outdated by today’s standards, but it continues to serve me well. With the ever-rising prices of newer models — and only minor upgrades in return — I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade anytime soon. It’s fast, reliable, and handles everything I throw at it.</p><p id="24077955-515e-80fb-b450-ecfa88dd5ab5" class="">The only real downside is the camera, which feels a bit dated compared to the latest models, but for everyday use, it’s more than enough. I’ll be sticking with it for as long as I can.</p><p id="23777955-515e-8031-ba6b-f8436ca72128" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-809a-bd2f-e4ae1dfa0c01" class=""><strong>G-SHOCK GW-M5610-UBC </strong>[<a href="https://www.casio.com/europe/watches/gshock/product.GW-M5610U-1B/">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-8019-acda-e2039fa277ba" class="">I’ve been wearing an Apple Watch Series 3 for many years, but last year it got damaged, and since then I have been looking for an alternative. I wanted to try something else, as I got really upset with the battery life on the smart watches.</p><p id="24077955-515e-80df-85ae-ceea8a18dd18" class="">The design is clean and rugged, battery life is practically infinite thanks to solar charging, and it still packs in all the core features I actually need. Mine came with a metal bracelet that’s apparently exclusive to Japan, which makes it feel even more special. The negative display gets a lot of hate online, but honestly, it’s not that bad — only a bit tricky in poor lighting, and the backlight solves that anyway. All in all, I’m really happy with the switch.</p><p id="23777955-515e-8033-a01b-c212c6f9aed7" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-8084-919b-c13635905f56" class=""><strong>Airpods Pro </strong>[<a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-8089-ac48-e8f60f484e0e" class="">An absolute no-brainer — I genuinely can’t imagine life without them. This is already my third pair, and I’d buy another without hesitation. The sound quality is solid, the noise canceling is incredibly effective, and the battery life never lets me down. Whether I’m on the move, working, or just zoning out, the AirPods Pro are always in my pocket.</p><p id="23777955-515e-805d-a869-dccdace73a90" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-806f-b792-e975d8d0e9ae" class=""><strong>Anker Power Bank </strong>[<a href="https://www.anker.com/eu-en/products/a1610?variant=42364656779454">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-8041-8475-e272da2acd55" class="">Another great find from Japan, this compact Anker power bank is my go-to for emergencies. It’s not the most powerful — it won’t fully recharge my phone more than once — but the slim, sleek design makes it incredibly convenient. Thanks to MagSafe, it snaps right onto the back of the phone without any cables, making it perfect for quick top-ups when I don’t want to carry around a bigger power bank. It’s the kind of thing you forget you’re carrying — until you’re glad you did.</p><p id="24077955-515e-803d-baee-da6373195f5d" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-80d6-9ab0-c872fcf20bf7" class=""><strong>WESN Microblade </strong>[<a href="https://wesn.com/products/microblade?variant=31197014524017">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-80be-879d-f0ae7d0a7a75" class="">I’m completely in love with this tiny knife. After searching for ages, I finally found something that nails both form and function without all the weird gimmicks. Most compact knives either go overboard with flashy designs or come with extra stuff I don’t need — but the Microblade keeps it simple and clean. It’s beautifully minimal, incredibly well-built, and just feels right. Exactly what I’d been looking for.</p><p id="23777955-515e-8026-9099-cd25cfa7984c" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-80f6-bef7-cb56f23afe63" class=""><strong>Arduboy FX </strong>[<a href="https://www.arduboy.com/">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-80d3-8ea5-f36d51710ccb" class="">This tiny handheld console is packed with over 300 retro-style games — all running on Arduino hardware. It’s barely bigger than a credit card, yet delivers endless entertainment in a minimalist package. I absolutely love how portable and hackable it is — perfect for quick gaming sessions or just geeking out over what it can do. A true gem for anyone who appreciates tiny tech done right.</p><p id="23777955-515e-8037-b632-ebf31fcc9f86" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-805b-9a4f-d003e16269ac" class=""><strong>AirTags </strong>[<a href="https://www.apple.com/airtag/">link</a>]</p><p id="24077955-515e-802a-b20f-f67e70e8b1ac" class="">I keep a couple of AirTags on my gear, and they’ve proven surprisingly useful. Whether it’s my backpack, keys, or even a travel bag, having that extra layer of tracking gives me peace of mind. Simple, effective, and easy to forget — until you need them.</p><p id="23777955-515e-80a2-b65d-e9ea2b8f4e08" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-8032-9b27-f748d5f3cb2b" class=""><strong>AirCard Pro </strong>[<a href="https://rollingsquare.com/products/aircard-pro-android-apple-bluetooth-tracker">link</a>]</p><p id="23777955-515e-80ff-8f01-e13ce0cedbaf" class="">This slim tracker shaped like a credit card slides right into my wallet without adding bulk. Unlike the usual AirTags, the AirCard Pro blends in seamlessly and looks pretty slick while doing it. It’s fully compatible with Apple’s Find My network, making it a great low-profile way to make sure I don’t lose my wallet.</p><p id="23777955-515e-8005-b085-e21ae9fb8bd6" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-8083-8c4d-d117663ca8c7" class=""><strong>iPod Classic &amp; iPod Nano 7th gen</strong></p><p id="23777955-515e-804a-8edb-f65a90944468" class="">iPods have recently become my latest obsession. There’s something really satisfying about stepping away from the always-connected world and just enjoying music — no notifications, no distractions. I’ve done some modding on the iPod Classic to bring it back to life, and it’s now a fun little project that I actually use. On the other hand, the iPod Nano 7th gen wins me over with its sleek, compact design — it’s crazy how small and functional it still is. Both give off that perfect hit of nostalgia, while still being surprisingly practical for focused listening.</p><p id="23777955-515e-800c-89ae-f3710cfcdccb" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-803d-b7a0-dc3b299b8260" class=""><strong>Porsche USB stick</strong></p><p id="23777955-515e-808d-a7d1-dabbe4a422db" class="">Let’s be real — who still uses USB drives these days? I rarely do, but this one’s an exception. I got it years ago as a gift, and despite barely using it, it’s earned a permanent spot on my desk. And it’s nice to have something ready for those rare moments when cloud storage just won’t cut it.</p><p id="23777955-515e-809c-93ed-c3d61acc1f8a" class="">
</p><p id="23777955-515e-80be-b7ae-f61884d7f200" class=""><strong>Zippo lighter </strong>[<a href="https://zippo.com/products/classic-high-polish-chrome-pipe-insert">link</a>]</p><p id="24077955-515e-80d5-b03c-ebc19a3f52cc" class="">There’s something undeniably iconic about a Zippo — the satisfying <em>clink</em> of the lid, the timeless chrome finish, and the vintage flair it adds to any EDC setup. I love the way it looks and feels in hand, but I’ll be honest: it’s not the most practical tool. The gasoline tends to evaporate quickly, even with minimal use, meaning I often have to carry a spare fuel bottle just to keep it functional. While it might win style points, it’s hard to justify as a truly reliable tool “out in the wild.” Still, I keep it in my kit but mostly for the aesthetics.</p></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span>
