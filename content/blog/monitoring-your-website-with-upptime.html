<article id="17077955-515e-801f-8184-eb8fd6ca7d7c" class="page sans"><div class="page-body"><p id="18e77955-515e-80f8-b805-cb145b918a7c" class="">Recently I‚Äôve encountered an unpleasant situation on one of the websites I manage. I randomly opened it only to find out it wasn‚Äôt working. Unfortunately, it was not a very important website, so no harm was done but the problem was that I didn‚Äôt know for how long it had been down. This is unacceptable, especially for the important websites that cannot go down.</p><p id="18e77955-515e-80c8-8787-ff9fb78515dd" class="">Therefore, I did research on some tools that would help me with monitoring the website status and notify me when something goes south again in the future.</p><p id="18e77955-515e-802e-82d1-f20137943834" class="">I came across an <strong>open-source</strong> tool called <a href="https://upptime.js.org/">Upptime</a>, a monitoring solution that you can easily configure to constantly monitor the specified HTTP endpoints. It is <strong>Github-based</strong>, which means you can easily clone the <a href="https://github.com/upptime/upptime">repository</a> by clicking on the ‚Äú<em>Use this template</em>‚Äù. It uses <strong>Github Actions </strong>for constantly checking the configured endpoints and then commits the results back to your Git repository üíØ.</p><p id="18e77955-515e-80cc-b0a0-f2269fb308d5" class="">By default, it checks the website<strong> every 5 minutes </strong>and commits a daily report once a day, but this is configurable. Whenever your website goes down or is unresponsive, Upptime creates a new <strong>GitHub issue</strong> and sends you a notification. There are several channels that you can configure for receiving those alerts, such as <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>Telegram</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, or even <strong>SMS</strong>.</p><p id="18e77955-515e-80ca-a2d0-dc0d4b80a042" class="">It comes with a static <strong>status page</strong> that reads the data from your repository and you can freely customize it as you like. It can look similar to this and can be easily deployed to <strong>Github Pages</strong>, for instance.</p><figure id="18e77955-515e-8021-a8d8-e9fba926f045" class="image"><a href="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/17077955515e801f8184eb8fd6ca7d7c/status-page.png"><img style="width:2322px" src="https://assets.jozefcipa.com/blog/17077955515e801f8184eb8fd6ca7d7c/status-page.png"></a></figure><p id="18e77955-515e-805e-b925-f187732a5b69" class="">Check out their <a href="https://upptime.js.org/docs/get-started">getting started</a> guide and follow all the steps to set it up. The whole process is super straightforward and doesn‚Äôt take more than half an hour to complete.</p><p id="18e77955-515e-80e8-bd17-ff26a21da3c7" class="">And after that, you can start sleeping without worries again üòÅ.</p></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span>
