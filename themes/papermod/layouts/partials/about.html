        <section class="about-me">
            I'm a software developer with more than <strong> {{ (sub now.Year 2016 )}} years of experience</strong>, focusing on web applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            I began working on part-time in an agency while still in high school.
            This started my career as a full-stack developer with <strong>PHP & jQuery</strong> back in 2016.
            <br>
            Since then I've came across different technologies and projects; I also worked with Python, switched jQuery for ReactJS and later moved to NodeJS.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later on I joined STRV, which was my dream job from high school, and became a backend developer, leaving my FE skills in the past.
            <br>
            After working and seeing only the backend side for a few years, I started discovering <strong>cloud and DevOps</strong>.
            <br>
            I really liked it and decided to get an <strong>AWS Solutions Architect certificate</strong> to learn more about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nowadays, I'm still primarily a NodeJS developer, but I'm interested in technologies like <strong>Terraform, Kubernetes, networking and distributed systems</strong>.
            <br>
            When writing code, I'm always trying to think a few steps ahead and guess the possible issues or raise questions.
            I <strong>love learning from more experienced developers</strong> and I always appreciate a constructive feedback.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm a minimalist with an eye for detail. I'm always <strong>curious about how things work under the hood</strong>, that's why I'm currently studying Kubernetes and one day I'd love to take a <strong>closer look at Linux and assembler</strong> ü§ì.
            I'm not afraid to get in touch with unknown or start new things which I don't know much about. I prefer <strong>learning by doing</strong>, therefore working on something new while figuring out how it works is always my way to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>When I'm not coding</strong> or reading some cool nerdy stuff, I very much enjoy travelling&nbsp;‚úàÔ∏è, hiking&nbsp;üèî and riding my motorcycle&nbsp;üèç.

                As I'm an introvert, public speaking was a nightmare for me for a long time.
                It took me a lot of time, courage and stepping out of my comfort zone
                to be able to finally have my first internal presentation at work üò∞. <br>
                After that I kept pushing and had two public talks within half a year !!!
                As one would say, it's not a lot but it's honest work.
                Keeping that in mind I still try to overcome my fears and continue with that challenge of mine üí™.
