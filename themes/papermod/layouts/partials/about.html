            I'm a software developer with <strong> {{ (sub now.Year 2016 )}}+ years</strong> of experience, focusing on web applications.<br>
            <br>
            I focus mainly on backend development in <span class="technology">Node.js</span>,
            but also have a lot of experience with <span class="technology">React.js</span> and frontend development. 
            In the past, I also worked with PHP, jQuery, and a little bit of Python.
            <br>
            Currently, I‚Äôm exploring <span class="technology">Go</span> and <span class="technology">Rust</span>
            and recently I got interested in <span class="technology">IoT</span> and automation.
            <br>
            <br>
            When writing code, I always think several steps ahead and try to predict possible issues that could cause problems in the future.
            <br>
            I <strong>love learning from more experienced developers</strong> and I always appreciate constructive feedback.
            <br>
            I'm a minimalist with an eye for detail. I'm always <strong>curious about how things work under the hood</strong> and try to understand the specifics. One day I'd love to take a closer look at <strong>Linux internals</strong> ü§ì.
            <br>
            I'm not afraid to tackle the unknown or start new things that I don't know a lot about.
            I prefer <strong>learning by doing</strong>, therefore working on something new while figuring out how it works is the way to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I'm not coding or studying something, I really enjoy <em>exploring new countries</em>&nbsp;üåé and <em>riding my motorcycle</em>&nbsp;üèç.
