                So far, I've had a chance to make sure all employees can submit their concerns to <a href="https://www.allvoices.co/" class="link">AllVoices</a>.

                Apart from my full time work I sometimes work for other clients as well. I can help with NodeJS or ReactJS and also any backend / DevOps related stuff.
                I can also take a look at your project, do a code review, answer your questions, give some insights to your codebase or consult your project or idea.

                Focused mainly on e-commerce projects written in PHP, using the custom robust CMS solution.
                I worked here on part time during my studies in high school which allowed me to learn and gain a lot of experience as a junior developer.

                If I would be to create a tech start-up tomorrow, Jozef will be in the first 3 people I'll be trying to hire!
                He reminds me of one of those wiz-kids that has the natural talent to grasp and learn and start doing anything related to computers in a lightning-speed manner.
                His approach to code structuring and architecture are on a high level and I always enjoyed reading his PRs, because I could even learn something new and interesting from them.
                The communication with Jozef was always super easy-going and fun, be it professional or not. Discussing technical problems with him was a breeze and that's always very important and helpful in a team!
